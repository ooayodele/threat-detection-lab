Home lab for cybersecurity simulations using Kali Linux and Wireshark.


# Threat Detection Lab

## Overview
This project simulates real-world cybersecurity incidents using a home lab setup with VirtualBox and Kali Linux. The goal is to detect and analyze threats using industry-standard tools like Wireshark and Metasploit.

## Features
- Configured a virtualized network to simulate attacks.
- Detected suspicious traffic using Wireshark.
- Conducted penetration tests to identify vulnerabilities and implemented remediations.

## Tools Used
- **Wireshark**: Traffic analysis
- **Metasploit**: Exploit simulations
- **VirtualBox**: Virtual environment setup

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Improved threat detection capabilities.
- Analyzed network traffic for Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).
- Built technical reports on vulnerabilities and remediations.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up the virtual lab environment using the included configuration files.
3. Follow the step-by-step guide in `instructions.md` to replicate the experiments.
